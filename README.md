# The Privacy Power of Correlated Noise in Decentralized Learning

## Instructions

* Download library requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
### Reproducing the paper's experiments:
* Run file [quadratics.py](quadratics.py) or command `python3 quadratics.py` to get our experiments on Synthetic data (Linear Regression).
* Run file 'reproduce_libsvm.py' or command `python3 reproduce_libsvm.py` to get the experiements on the LibSVM dataset a9a. You can also add to the command `--supercharge x` to run 2x experiments at the same time. Numerical results will be shown in the folder: `DECOR/results-data-libsvm/` and the plots in: `DECOR/results-plot-libsvm/`
* Run file 'reproduce_mnist.py' or command `python3 reproduce_mnist.py` to get the experiements on the MNIST dataset (available on torchvision library in PyTorch).
* Fetch results in folder XXX
